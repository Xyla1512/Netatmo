# Changelog

All notable changes to the Netatmo Weather Station (NAWS) plugin are documented here.

## [1.0.2] – 2026-03-10

### Removed
- **Shortcode `[naws_chart]`** – Standalone chart widget removed (charts remain in `[naws_live]` and `[naws_history]`)
- **Shortcode `[naws_gauge]`** – Gauge widget removed
- **Shortcode `[naws_dashboard]`** – Dashboard widget removed (use `[naws_live]` instead)
- **Shortcode `[naws_card]`** – Single metric card removed (use `[naws_value]` instead)
- **gauge.min.js** vendor library – No longer needed
- Templates: `chart.php`, `dashboard.php`, `gauge.php`, `card.php`

### Fixed
- **Fatal error on activation**: `spawn_cron()` was called during `plugins_loaded` when `WP_CRON_LOCK_TIMEOUT` is not yet defined. Removed `spawn_cron()` call.

## [1.0.1] – 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Forecast provider selection**: Choose between Open-Meteo (global) and Yr.no / MET Norway (Northern Europe)
- **Norwegian (Bokmål) language**: 326 translated keys (`languages/no.php`)
- **File-based language system**: Each language is a separate PHP file in `/languages/`. Auto-discovered by settings dropdown. Adding a language = adding one file.
- **Configurable station name**: New field in Settings → General. Used as default title in live dashboard and shortcodes. Fallback: WordPress site title.
- **Manual sync logging**: "Sync Now" button now writes entries to the Cron Log
- **Yr.no privacy disclosure** in `readme.txt`

### Fixed
- **OAuth flow broken by encryption**: Removed AES encryption from Client ID/Secret (appeared as `naws_enc:...` in OAuth URL). Tokens remain encrypted. Auto-migration decrypts on update.
- **OAuth state validation**: Replaced unreliable transient with `wp_option`. Added `hash_equals()` + 10-min expiry. Prevents state overwrite during callback page render.
- **Disconnect button non-functional**: Missing `action="admin-post.php"` in form.
- **Forecast manual location fails**: Open-Meteo Geocoding API rejects postcodes. Input now auto-cleaned (`"Leipzig / 04105"` → `"Leipzig"`).
- **Cron stops after plugin update**: Added `register_activation_hook` for `NAWS_Cron::schedule()`. Watchdog schedules next run in future (not `time()`), calls `spawn_cron()`, and runs immediate sync.
- **Silent cron abort**: `do_fetch()` no longer returns silently when credentials missing – always logs reason.
- **SVG weather icons stripped**: `wp_kses_post()` removes SVG tags. Replaced with direct output + `phpcs:ignore` for trusted internal SVGs.
- **"Uhr" hardcoded in English**: Replaced with language key `time_suffix` (DE: "Uhr", EN/NO: empty).
- **REST API docs parse error**: `phpcs:ignore` comments had swallowed semicolons and closing parentheses.
- **Shortcodes page parse error**: Extra closing parenthesis in `esc_html()` wrapper.

### Improved
- **Plugin Check compliance**: 126 errors → 0. Added `esc_html()`/`esc_attr()`, replaced `date()` with `wp_date()`/`gmdate()`, added `phpcs:ignore` for legitimate patterns.
- **Vendor JS files bundled**: `chart.umd.min.js`, `chartjs-adapter-date-fns.bundle.min.js`, `gauge.min.js` now included in ZIP. No manual download after updates.
- **Language class refactored**: From 1035-line monolithic file to 195-line loader + separate language files. Scales to unlimited languages.
